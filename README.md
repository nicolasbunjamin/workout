# THE RECOMMENDED ROUTINE
#### Video Demo (URL HERE)

The Recommended Routine is a web application based off of
/r/bodyweightfitness's Recommended Routine. You can access the full guide here
(https://www.reddit.com/r/bodyweightfitness/wiki/kb/recommended_routine).
This web application is submitted as my final project for HarvardX's CS50
(https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/project/).

## How to Use

Usage is very straightforward. Simply select your desired training level
between 1 and 5, where level 1 is the most beginner-friendly
and level 5 is the most difficult and advanced.

The web application will then give you a series of instructions you are
to complete one at a time. Most of the instructions are rep-based exercises,
but there are rest periods and time-based exercises too.
During those rest periods and time-based exercises,
the web app will display a timer.

## Features

This web page includes:
* Five different levels of training level for each muscle groups
* Additional warm-up exercises for more advanced user
* An automatic timer for rest periods and time-based exercises
